It is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend [APP](https://github.com/iuryveloso/corelab-web-challenge), and [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/) + [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) for the backend REST [API](https://github.com/iuryveloso/corelab-api-challenge).

Clone the [APP](https://github.com/iuryveloso/corelab-web-challenge) repository.

Create a copy of the ```.env.example``` file in the app's root folder. Rename it to ```.env``` and change the necessary information.
